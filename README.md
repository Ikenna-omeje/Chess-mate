## Testing 
+ I can comfirm that i have tested the wedsite in different browsers: Chrome, Safari and firefox.
+ I can confirm that the project is responsive and looks good and function on all standard screen sizes using device toolbar.
+ i can comfirm that the navigations, header , contact , texts and are all readable, visually appealing and easily understandable.
+ i can comfirm that the form entries are responsive, the email field can only accept email adresses with the required @ function.

-some of the bugs i encounted was my inability to make certain codes function as intended, but this was resolved with the aid of student tutors by helping me target the paticular element. this helped resolve alot of issues, for example creating id's for:
- #activity-page {}, 
- #signup-page {},
- #context-text {}
